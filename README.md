# recurrent-neural-notes

Exam project in the [Deep Learning course][deep-learning] at DTU.

A GRU-network model for next-step prediction of notes in the Nottingham folk-melody dataset. 

The model is also expanded to feeding the previous prediction from the output-network as input to the GRU-input-network, so as to be able to generate new sequences of notes from an initial one.

The final documentation of the project and results can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4fs83z07st24p3/report.pdf?dl=0).
