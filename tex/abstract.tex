We present two models both using a recurrent neural network to reconstruct music and for the latter model generate music.
We use these models on a large data set of folk tunes from which melodies are extracted for the models to recreate.
We test these models using both $L_2$ regularisation and the dropout technique.
Both models achieve accuracies of around $\SI{37}{\%}$ for predicting pitches and of around $\SI{75}{\%}$ for predicting durations.
We also take a closer look at reconstructions from the best models, and find that they keep the musical structure, like rhythmical motifs and musical scales, two of the cornerstones in musical theory.
