We present two models both using a recurrent neural network to reconstruct music and for the latter model generate music.
We use these models on a large data set of folk tunes from which extract melodies for the models to recreate.
We test these models using both $L_2$ regularisation and the dropout technique.
Both models achieve accuracies of around $\SI{37}{\%}$ for predicting pitches and of around $\SI{75}{\%}$ for predicting durations.
We also look take a closer look at reconstruction from the best model, and find\dots \change{Finish sentence.}
